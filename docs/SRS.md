## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the Inventory & Sales Management System. This system is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their inventory, process sales transactions, and generate insightful reports. The document will serve as a reference for developers, stakeholders, and testers throughout the development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Scope

The Inventory & Sales Management System is a web-based application that provides comprehensive inventory and sales management capabilities. The system will offer:

* Product management (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Real-time stock level tracking with automatic updates on sales
* Order management (create order, process payment, update stock)
* Sales reporting with filtering capabilities (by date range, product, cashier)
* Role-based access control supporting different user roles:
  * **Administrator**: Full system access including product management, order processing, reporting, and user management
  * **Cashier**: Limited access focused on order creation, stock viewing, and basic reporting

The system will be developed as a full-stack Next.js application, utilizing MongoDB Atlas for data persistence and deployed on Vercel for optimal performance and scalability.

### 1.5 Overview

The remainder of this document describes the specific requirements for the Inventory & Sales Management System. Sections 2 and 3 provide detailed descriptions of the system's functionality and requirements. Section 4 provides a high-level overview of the system design.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The Inventory & Sales Management System is a standalone web application that will interface with MongoDB Atlas for data storage. The system will be accessible through modern web browsers and will not require any additional software installation on the client side.

The system consists of the following major components:
- User Authentication Module
- Product Management Module
- Stock Management Module
- Order Processing Module
- Reporting Module
- User Management Module

### 2.2 Product Functions

The system's primary functions include:
1. User authentication and authorization with role-based access control
2. Product catalog management with CRUD operations
3. Real-time inventory tracking with automatic stock updates
4. Order creation and processing with payment handling
5. Comprehensive reporting with export capabilities
6. User management for administrator role

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The system will be used by two primary types of users:
1. **Administrators**: Technically proficient users responsible for system configuration, product management, and user administration. They require full access to all system features.
2. **Cashiers**: Frontline staff responsible for processing customer orders. They require a simple, intuitive interface for creating orders and viewing inventory.

Both user types will access the system through web browsers and should be able to accomplish their tasks with minimal training.

### 2.4 Constraints

1. The system must be deployed using Vercel and MongoDB Atlas within their free-tier limitations
2. Initial release will support single branch/location operations
3. Payment integration (e.g., Stripe) is optional for MVP
4. Development must be completed within allocated time and resource constraints
5. All data must be stored in compliance with applicable privacy regulations

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

1. Users will have access to modern web browsers with JavaScript enabled
2. Stable internet connection will be available for all users
3. System administrators will have technical knowledge to configure initial system settings
4. Third-party services (Vercel, MongoDB Atlas) will maintain required uptime levels
5. Users will have appropriate training on system usage
